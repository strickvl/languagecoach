    <h2 id="whatiscoachbot">What is CoachBot?</h1>

<p>Are you trying to teach yourself a language? Are you at an upper-beginner or intermediate level? Do you ever sit down to study and wonder what you should do?</p>

<p>CoachBot is a free tool designed to deal with this problem. I've studied several languages and know the paralysis that can come at the intermediate level: there are too many options and you just need someone to tell you what to study and for how long.</p>

<p>CoachBot gives you a task that you can complete within a specific time-frame. If you have only 5 minutes, it'll pick a random task from the database that I curated and wrote myself. Have an hour? It'll suggest a different kind of task. If you don't want to do a particular task, just click to get a new one.</p>

<p>These are the kinds of tasks I suggest when <a href="/coaching">working with students one-on-one</a>. Now you can benefit from these suggestions at any time of the day.</p>
